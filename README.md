# Flixplore
Flixplore helps you choose a movie to watch when you crave a particular **Genre** or **Language**.  
It takes in your input for the genre, language, and year of release and suggests random movies that satisfy the criteria.  
You can leave any of these three fields empty and let Flixplore suggest a wild movie list.  
It uses the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) in its [back-end](https://github.com/prasanna-rkumar/flixplore-api).
